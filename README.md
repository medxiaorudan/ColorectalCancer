## **The system consists of three pages: the Home page, the Upload page and the About page.**
## **Introduction**
We have established a website for genetic risk assessment related to colorectal cancer. Using population cohort research methods, we compare the genetic information characteristics of patients and control populations and identify gene loci related to the occurrence of the disease. It can parse the gene mutation information submitted by users and return colorectal cancer risk assessment. It can be used for colorectal cancer genetic risk assessment, targeted drug selection, etc.
## **Home page**
- ### The page consists of three main parts: disease background, system overview and overall structural process.

## **Upload page**
- ### When the VCF file is not uploaded, the system automatically displays the graph of the thousand human genome in the risk of colorectal cancer.

- ### After the user uploads the VCF file, the user can obtain the genetic position in the thousand human genome and inform the OR value and relative genetic risk. The figure shows the relative genetic risk of colorectal cancer, the blue arrow shows the relative genetic risk of the user in the thousands of human genomes, the curve shows the genetic risk of the thousands of human genomes, and the horizontal axis is the natural value of the relative risk OR after normalization. Logarithm, the vertical axis is the population probability density of the corresponding OR value.
- ### If the user uploads a VCF file that does not contain a risk site in the colorectal cancer-related risk locus library, the system will prompt the user that the document passed does not contain colorectal cancer-related sites.
## **About page**
- ### This page shows questions, github links, author information and lab links.
